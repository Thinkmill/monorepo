A frontend app with backend services. 
A frontend app with a design system.
A GraphQL API with a frontend app.
 
 




A monorepo for an open source library will look different to a monorepo of React Native apps. 

Each monorepo is built around the needs of an organisation and its software requirements.

Before you can build your monorepo, the best place to start is thinking about - what are the capabilities that you need?

You might want to: 
* share code between apps
* create a design system 
* publish packages to npm 
* create a library

As a monorepo matures, it will also serve to codify the organisation's workflow policies.

These might be: 
* rules for how to deploy 
* development workflows
* file linting
* specific testing tools
* branch naming conventions 
* conventions for sharing features between apps 
* policies for how to bump multi-package dependencies, like React
* environment requirements
  
Then there might be other interventions: 
* Semantic versioning requirements 
* App generators
* Bundle size limitations
* Automated documentation publishing 

Because the requirements and capabilities the monorepo is so broad and ranging, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.
